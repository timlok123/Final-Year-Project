# Final-Year-Project 

This GitHub Repository is set up to store the code of my final year project. My final project is writtern in OOP and it covers 

1. The measurements of entanglement entropy of 1D transverse field Ising model

There are 2 main motivations for me setting to set up this repository

1. To share the code with my final year project peers and open for discussion
2. To back up my final year project code
